      "Hill climbing seems like a pretty straightforward algorithm, especially when using schotastic successor generations. As long as our fitness function is well defined the algorithm will always reach its target. The one downside to the algorithm implemented above is that generating single random successor states can result in generating a state that moves away from the target state instead of closer.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be possible to make schotastic successor generation smarter. For instance, we can compare each element of the state and determine which ones actually need to be changed. We can modify the probability distribution to match the fitness curve generated in order to generate better successors. The problem though is that we're slowly moving away from schotastic generation if we do. I feel like there is a balance between the two approaches though.\n",

      "The crossover function is one that needs special attenation. The algorithm implemented above used a random crossover position to generate the offspring but I feel that this could be done better. For instance, would it not be better to generate a crossover value that takes into account the fitness of the state? Rather than be random, we could select a position around a group of elements that have a high fitness value. This would require calculating which group of elements have the better fitness function; not only that, what comprises \"better\"? This comparison is O(n^2) which can be very expensive."
